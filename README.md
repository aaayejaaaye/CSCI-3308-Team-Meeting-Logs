### What we've done: 
- Basic HTML parser (parses div/header tags, etc.) (Andrew)
- Basic front-end website page (allows for URL text-entry) (Jake)
- Scope of the SQL Database (used for storing login info, previous websites searched, and (maybe) documents of downloaded files)

### What we still need to do:
- **IMPORTANT UPDATE -** We've decided that, because of the way that parsing metadata about images/text/css can be tricky on public-facing sites, we are going to take in multiple websites and compare similarities, almost like a plagirism checker!

- Continue to work on script
- Create a front-end page for the basic design of the website (Jake)
- Set up a basic SQL database to store username/password info 
- Create a login modal on the homepage

### Other ways to make this more interesting: 
- Include how many times a pages has been searched
- Include how often pages are being searched
