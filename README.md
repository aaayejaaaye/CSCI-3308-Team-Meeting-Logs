## 11/13/2019 - Team Meeting
#### What we've done: 
- Continued scoping and planning on the specifics of our app - narrowing the gap bettween unknowns and knowns. This includes planning for Heroku, planning for a loading page  (or rather, a loading animation to play while the script is running) 
    -- This will basically just be a loading gif that spins on the results page until the Python finshes running, API gets called, and javascript/jquery is 
- Dicussion of how Heroku will get all of these components to talk to each other 
- Use NodeJH to Call bash script to run python. Using Heroku. 
- Version 12 of PostGres for database setup? Seems like the best 
- Using Heroku with Node JS to make an API call: 


**Front end site takes in input -> calls API with URL calls -> loading page -> JavaScript** 

### What we still need to do:
**Jake**
 * Create loading animation/page for back-end
 * Populate back-end with data from dummy json file (based on real input) 
 * Fix front-end to handle multiple URL calls
 
**Fengyuan** 
 * Create a local database for data 
 * Make some filler/dummy data (user's data) 

**Andrew**
 * Help with PieChart for Javascript 
 * Continue working on Python script 
 
**Yuxi** 
 * Work with Fengyuan's database to populate login page 
 
**AJ**
 * Figuring out Heroku, database management (calling that from the database) 
 
**Other stuff** 
 * Possible integration with Python instead of NodeJS.

## 10/30/2019 - Team Meeting

#### What we've done: 
- Basic HTML parser (parses div/header tags, etc.) (Andrew)
- Basic front-end website page (allows for URL text-entry) (Jake)
- Scope of the SQL Database (used for storing login info, previous websites searched, and (maybe) documents of downloaded files)

#### What we still need to do:
- **IMPORTANT UPDATE -** We've decided that, because of the way that parsing metadata about images/text/css can be tricky on public-facing sites, we are going to take in multiple websites and compare similarities, almost like a plagirism checker!

- Continue to work on script
- Create a front-end page for the basic design of the website (Jake)
- Set up a basic SQL database to store username/password info 
- Create a login modal on the homepage

#### Other ways to make this more interesting: 
- Include how many times a pages has been searched
- Include how often pages are being searched
